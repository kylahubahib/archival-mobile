HOW TO USE LARAVEL API TO REACT-NATIVE?

# When running the laravel server ensure to use this command:
php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000

# Next, go to utils/axios.js and configure the url that will be used. Use your local ip address and ensure 
# that you're in the same network of the mobile device you're configuring (ipconfig to check the ipv4)

# Also check for the http:// and https:// . Remember that you can't use the api if they're different. 
# Example: When you start the expo project the url is https but since laravel has an http in the url, the api won't work

# If you want to wirelessly connect your project in expo go use this command:
npx expo start --tunnel

# If you want to clear cache of the expo project use this:
npx expo start --clear
# Since sometimes, some parts in your code might not be rendered if you didnt clear the cache

# If you wanna check and install some dependencies that expo requires, use this command:
npx expo-doctor
# Using this will help you identify what's wrong with your project

REMINDER:
# You cant use secure store in the web version so the code might have an error.

After cloning or forking the project, run the command npm install
